    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).<br>
    Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.<br>
        LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy).<br>
        Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts.<br>
        Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</p>
